In this post, I list some of the important Brew commands

# Global commands

```
```bash

```
```bash
brew update     # update brew and cask
```
```bash
brew upgrade     # update all outdated packages
```
```bash

```
```bash
brew outdated	# Whatâ€™s due for upgrades?
```

## Installing a particular version of a package
All the cask files are located at ``/usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-cask/Casks``

Open the one you want to chagne and modify the "version" ans "sha256"

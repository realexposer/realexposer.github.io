# TFT 1.8" display - ST7735
The ST7735 TFT display is a 1.8″ display with a resolution of 128×160 pixels and can display a wide range of colors ( full 18-bit color, 262,144 shades!). The display uses the SPI protocol for communication and has its own pixel-addressable frame buffer which means it can be used with all kinds of microcontroller and you only need 4 i/o pins. To complement the display, it also comes with an SD card slot on which colored bitmaps can be loaded and easily displayed on the screen.

**Other features of the display include:**

* 1.8″ diagonal LCD TFT display
* 128×160 resolution, 18-bit (262,144) color
* 4 or 5 wire SPI digital interface
* Built-in microSD slot – uses 2 more digital lines
* 5V compatible! Use with 3.3V or 5V logic
* Onboard 3.3V @ 150mA LDO regulator
* 2 white LED backlight, a transistor connected so you can PWM dim the backlight
* 1×10 header for easy breadboarding
* 4 x 0.9″/2mm mounting holes in corners
* Overall dimensions: 1.35″ x 2.2″ x 0.25″ (34mm x 56mm x 6.5mm)
* Current draw is based on LED backlight usage: with full backlight draw is ~50mA

The goal of this tutorial is to demonstrate the abilities of the TFT to display images and text in different colors and some animation.
